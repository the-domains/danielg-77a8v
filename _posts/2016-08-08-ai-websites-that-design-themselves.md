OK. I GET IT!

Instead of having FB, LinkedIn, or Wordpress manage the look-and-feel or my professional field...

...and instead of creating the site myself and spending hours working on something that will still look inferior...

...or paying someone to do that for me and getting annoyed that they are not doing it how I want...

There is The Grid!
