OK. I GET IT!

Instead of having FB, LinkedIn, or Wordpress manage the look-and-feel or my professional field...

...and instead of creating the site myself and spending hours working on something that will still look inferior...

...or paying someone to do that for me and getting annoyed that they are not doing it how I want...

There is The Grid!

The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. As your needs grow, it evolves with you, effortlessly adapting to your needs.</p></article>
